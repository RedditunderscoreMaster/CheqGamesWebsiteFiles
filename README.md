CheqGamesWebsiteFiles
=====================

Post and edit the website files for Cheq Games here.

Comment your code as much as possible

This will mostly be HTML/CSS, with possible PHP/JS/XML/AJAX/JSON files in the future.

I made some rough copies of ideas I had for a general layout.  They're not finished, so I will post them in a separate
folder and update them as needed.  I would like to request that these remain unedited by persons other than myself.  

If you have code files you want posted here, email them to me at Redditunderscoremaster@gmail.com and I will post them 
for you.
