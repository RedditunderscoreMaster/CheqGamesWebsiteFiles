I will list the changes I have made to the pages here.

Version 0.0.1 = General theme is envisioned.  Quick HTML/CSS docs are composed and Copy/Pasted and altered slightly
to emulate the different pages.  Screenshots of the logos are hosted on other websites, will be changed later.  
Screenshots are also uneven, will also be fixed later.  Footer will be added.  Nav bar on the top will be altered
to allow for more links to be added later on.  "News Feed" will scroll independently of the nav bar/footer.
